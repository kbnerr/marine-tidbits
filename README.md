# KBNERR-marine-tidbits

<<<<<<< HEAD
KBNERR has been collecting surface water temperature since the early days of the reserve (ca. 2002). Some locations have been continuously sampled to this day, while other collections have been sporadic and short-lived. A consistent method has been used thoruhgout- Hobo Temperature Loggers ('tidbits') placed at approximately 1 meter depth. At times, temperature logger deployments have been paired with conductivity or light loggers, but those data have not been added here yet.
