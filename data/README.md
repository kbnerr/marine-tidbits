Description of Files

Data are collected from of five main locations: Bear Cove, Halibut Cove, Peterson Bay, Jakolof Bay, and Kasitsna Bay.
Data are split into three groups based on file type and stage of QAQC: hobo data files, raw csv, and cleaned csv.
File naming convention generally follows location_start:YYYYMMDD.end:YYYYMMDD.
Users will most likely want to stick with the cleaned data files, which should have been thru QAQC.
Data has been wrangled from an old messy system... 
Previous data compiling was done in Microsoft Access, and the latest version (ca. 2016) is added here- included are historic site descriptions and data from 'one-off' collections.
Raw and cleaned files prior to the last compiling for that site are not included, since these are assumed to already have been QAQC'd.

All Hobo data files are kept for records; some files are known to be missing; where other file types were used (e.g., donated data), then files were kept as is and file names changed to common naming convention.
Raw csv files will be deleted once QAQC is confirmed.
Ideally there will be a single updated and cleaned .csv file for each location.
