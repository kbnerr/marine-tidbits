Description of Files

Data are split into three groups based on file type and stage of QAQC: /hobo, /raw, and /clean. File naming convention is location_start-YYYYMMDD.end-YYYYMMDD. Users will most likely want to use the clean data files, which should be able to be easily tidy'd for exploration or other analyses.
